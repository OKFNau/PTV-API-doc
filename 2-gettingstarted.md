#Getting started
###First steps: getting your security key and developer ID
You'll need to pass along a signature and a developer ID &ndash; or "devid" - with every request using HTTP GET.
To calculate the signature, you'll need the request, which includes your developer ID, and a key.
The key consists of a 128bit GUID.
  





###How to register for a key and developer ID
* Send an email to APIKeyRequest@ptv.vic.gov.au with the following information in the subject line of the email:
   * "PTV Timetable API &ndash; request for key"
* Once we've got your email request, we'll send you a key and a developer ID by return email.
  





* We'll also add your email address to our API mailing list so we can keep you informed about the API.
