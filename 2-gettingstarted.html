      <h1>Getting started</h1>
<h3>First steps: getting your security key and developer ID</h3>
<p>You'll need to pass along a signature and a developer ID &ndash; or "devid" - with every request using HTTP GET.
To calculate the signature, you'll need the request, which includes your developer ID, and a key.
The key consists of a 128bit GUID.</p>
<p>The <strong>key</strong> and the <strong>request (including developer ID)</strong> are used to calculate a <strong>signature</strong> for every request.</p>
<h3>How to register for a key and developer ID</h3>
<ul>
<li>Send an email to APIKeyRequest@ptv.vic.gov.au with the following information in the subject line of the email:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"PTV Timetable API &ndash; request for key"</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Once we've got your email request, we'll send you a key and a developer ID by return email.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A high volume of requests may result in a delay in providing you with your key and developer ID. We'll try to get it to you as soon as we can.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We'll also add your email address to our API mailing list so we can keep you informed about the API.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The “APIKeyRequest” email address is only used to send you the key and developer ID and any relevant notifications. To provide feedback on the API check out our [Ed: ?].</p>
<p>PTV does not provide technical support on the API.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>Your email address is the only bit of information about you that PTV will hold in its register. You can view PTV's privacy policy at http://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/privacy.</p>
