      <h1>Getting started</h1>
<h3>First steps: getting your security key and developer ID</h3>
<p>You'll need to pass along a signature and a developer ID &ndash; or "devid" - with every request using HTTP GET.
To calculate the signature, you'll need the request, which includes your developer ID, and a key.
The key consists of a 128bit GUID.</p>
<h3>How to register for a key and developer ID</h3>
<ul>
<li>Send an email to APIKeyRequest@ptv.vic.gov.au with the following information in the subject line of the email:</li>
<li>"PTV Timetable API &ndash; request for key"</li>
<li>
<p>Once we've got your email request, we'll send you a key and a developer ID by return email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We'll also add your email address to our API mailing list so we can keep you informed about the API.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>Your email address is the only bit of information about you that PTV will hold in its register. You can view PTV's privacy policy at http://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/privacy.</p>
